# ETHPark: Smart Parking Marketplace
## Revolutionizing Urban Parking with Blockchain

---

## 🎯 The Problem

**Urban parking is a nightmare:**
- Drivers waste 20+ minutes searching for parking spots
- Empty driveways and garages sit unused

---

## 🔗 How Blockchain Powers This System

Think of blockchain as a **digital notary** that everyone trusts. Here's how we use it:

### 1. **Smart Contracts = Automated Agreements**

**Traditional Way:**
- Host and driver meet → Exchange money → Trust issues → What if someone lies?

**Our Way:**
```
Driver books spot → Money locked in smart contract → 
Parking happens → Time ends → Money released to host
```

**No one can cheat!** The code automatically enforces the rules.

### 2. **Escrow Protection**

- Driver's payment is **locked** in the smart contract
- Host can't take money early
- Driver can't cancel after booking
- When parking time ends, payment **automatically transfers** to host
- Both parties protected

### 3. **Transparent History**

- Every booking recorded on blockchain
- Can't delete or fake bookings
- Dispute resolution made easy
- Rating system based on real transactions

### 4. **No Centralized Control**

- We don't hold user money
- We can't block transactions
- Platform can't shut down suddenly
- Users truly own their data

### 5. **Sepolia Testnet (For Demo)**

- Using Ethereum's test network
- Free test tokens for demonstration
- Same security as real Ethereum
- No real money risk while testing
